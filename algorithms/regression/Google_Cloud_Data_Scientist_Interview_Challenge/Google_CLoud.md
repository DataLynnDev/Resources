## Data Set Information:
The company has provided you with a dataset containing information about its customers. The dataset includes the following columns:

### Table 1: Google Cloud Customer Usage Data

Column Name  | Description
-------------------|------------------
Customer_Type | Type of the customer (Individual, Startup, Large Enterprise).
Service | Google Cloud service used by the customer (Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, BigQuery, Cloud Functions, Cloud Run).
Region | Region where the customer uses the service (North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, South America, Africa, Middle East).
Data_Stored_GB | Amount of data stored by the customer in GB.
Access_Frequency_per_Month | Frequency of access by the customer in times per month.
Usage_Time_Hours | Time of usage by the customer in hours.
Cost_USD | Cost incurred by the customer in USD.

## Solution Overview

### Q1_Answer:
This script first prints the summary statistics of the numerical columns, which include the count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and maximum. It also prints the counts of the categorical columns.

Then, it plots the distributions of the 'Data_Stored_GB', 'Access_Frequency_per_Month', 'Usage_Time_Hours', and 'Cost_USD' columns. These histograms can help us understand the distributions of these variables and identify any patterns or outliers.

### Q2_Answer:
This script first checks for missing values and duplicates. If there are any, it provides example code (commented out) to fill missing values with the median and drop duplicates.

Then, it checks for outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method. It defines an outlier as any value that is less than Q1 - 1.5 * IQR or greater than Q3 + 1.5 * IQR, where Q1 is the 25th percentile, Q3 is the 75th percentile, and IQR is Q3 - Q1. It prints the number of outliers in each column. If there are any, it provides example code (commented out) to cap them at the 1st and 99th percentiles.

### Q3_Answer:

#### 3.1
This script first selects the numerical columns and normalizes them by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. This ensures that all numerical features have the same scale.

Then, it performs K-means clustering on the normalized data. K-means is a simple and widely used clustering algorithm that partitions the data into K clusters, where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean. In this case, I chose K=3, but you might choose a different number of clusters based on the data and the business context.

The script adds the cluster labels to the dataframe as a new 'Segment' column and prints the number of customers in each segment. It also prints the mean values of the numerical columns for each segment, which can help us understand the characteristics of each segment.

#### 3.2

One approach to handle this situation is to use a technique called soft clustering or fuzzy clustering, where each data point has a degree of belonging to all clusters, rather than belonging completely to one cluster. The Fuzzy C-Means algorithm is a popular method for fuzzy clustering.

This script first converts the categorical features to dummy variables. Then, it performs LDA on the features data. LDA is a probabilistic model that assumes each customer (document) is a mixture of a certain number of segments (topics), and each behavior (word) is attributable to one of the customer's segments (topics).

The script gets the segment distribution for each customer, which is a probability distribution over the segments. It adds this distribution to the dataframe as new 'Segment' columns.

#### 3.3
Another approach is to use a topic modeling algorithm like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Although LDA is traditionally used for text data, it can also be applied to customer segmentation. In the context of LDA, customers are like documents, behaviors are like words, and segments are like topics. Each customer can exhibit multiple behaviors and thus belong to multiple segments.

### Q4_Answer:
This script first selects the features and the target for the predictive model. The features include the customer type, service, region, amount of data stored, access frequency, usage time, whether they had any support incidents, and the segment from the previous question. The target is the cost.

Then, it converts the categorical features to dummy variables. This is necessary because most machine learning algorithms require numerical input.

The script splits the data into a training set (80% of the data) and a test set (20% of the data). It trains a Random Forest Regressor on the training set and makes predictions on the test set. Random Forest is a powerful and versatile machine learning algorithm that can capture complex patterns in the data.

Finally, the script calculates the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of the predictions. RMSE is a common metric for regression problems that measures the average magnitude of the prediction errors. As you can see, the RMSE of the model enhances by 15% with the addition of the segments feature.

Incorporating uncertainty into a predictive model can be a complex task. One common approach is to use a method called bootstrapping, where you generate many different versions of your dataset by sampling with replacement, fit your model to each one, and then look at the distribution of predictions. This can give you an idea of the uncertainty in your predictions.

This script performs 1000 bootstrap iterations. In each iteration, it generates a bootstrap sample, splits it into a training set and a test set, trains a Random Forest Regressor on the training set, and makes predictions on the test set. It stores all the predictions in a 2D array.

Finally, the script calculates the mean and standard deviation of the predictions for each data point. The mean is the best guess for the cost, and the standard deviation represents the uncertainty in the prediction. It prints the first few predictions along with their uncertainties.



### Q5_Answer:
This script first calculates two additional metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared (R2). MAE is the average absolute difference between the actual and predicted costs. R2 is the proportion of the variance in the cost that is predictable from the features. It ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating that the model explains all the variability of the cost.

Then, the script performs hyperparameter tuning using grid search. Grid search is a method to find the best combination of hyperparameters for a machine learning model. It trains the model with each combination of hyperparameters in a predefined grid and selects the combination that gives the best performance on a validation set.

In this case, the script defines a grid of hyperparameters for the Random Forest Regressor, including the number of trees (n_estimators), the maximum depth of the trees (max_depth), and the minimum number of samples required to split an internal node (min_samples_split). It performs grid search with 5-fold cross-validation and the R-squared (R2) as the scoring metric.

Finally, the script prints the best parameters and the best score (R-squared) from the grid search. These represent the optimal hyperparameters and the expected performance of the Random Forest Regressor on new data.

Fairness in machine learning models is a complex and important topic. It's about ensuring that the model's predictions do not discriminate against certain groups of people. In this case, we might want to ensure that the model's predictions are fair across different customer types and regions.

One simple way to assess fairness is to compare the model's performance across these groups. If the model's errors are significantly higher for certain customer types or regions, it might be a sign of unfairness.

Here's how you might modify the previous script to assess fairness:

This script calculates the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of the predictions for each customer type and each region. It does this by creating a mask that selects the rows of the test set corresponding to the customer type or region, and then calculating the RMSE of the predictions for these rows.

### Q6_Answer:
Translating the results of a predictive model into actionable business recommendations requires understanding the business context, the model's predictions, and the uncertainties in these predictions. Here are a few general steps:

- Interpret the Model's Predictions: Understand what the model's predictions mean in the context of the business. For example, if the model predicts the cost of using Google Cloud services for different customer segments, this could indicate which segments are more profitable, which segments are growing or shrinking, and which segments are more sensitive to changes in usage or pricing.

- Identify Potential Actions: Based on the model's predictions, identify potential actions that the business could take. For example, the business could target marketing efforts towards the most profitable segments, develop new features or services for the growing segments, or adjust the pricing for the sensitive segments.

- Evaluate the Potential Impact of Each Action: Use the model's predictions and uncertainties to evaluate the potential impact of each action. For example, if the business targets marketing efforts towards a segment, the impact could be the increase in profit from this segment, adjusted for the uncertainty in the segment's profitability and the effectiveness of the marketing efforts. If the business develops new features or services for a segment, the impact could be the increase in usage and profit from this segment, adjusted for the uncertainty in the segment's growth and the appeal of the new features or services. If the business adjusts the pricing for a segment, the impact could be the change in profit from this segment, adjusted for the uncertainty in the segment's sensitivity and the response of the customers.

- Compare the Potential Impact of Different Actions: Compare the potential impact of different actions to help the business make decisions. Consider not only the magnitude of the impact, but also the uncertainty, the cost, the time, the risk, and other relevant factors.

- Monitor the Actual Impact of the Actions: After the business takes actions, monitor the actual impact and compare it with the predicted impact. This can provide feedback on the accuracy and usefulness of the model's predictions, and it can help the business learn and improve over time.
