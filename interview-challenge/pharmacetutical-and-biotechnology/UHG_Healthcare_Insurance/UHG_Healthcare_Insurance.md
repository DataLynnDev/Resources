## 1. Business Problem Statement
United Health Group (UHG), a major health insurance provider, seeks to enhance its risk management through advanced data analytics. Given the industry's complexities, understanding and managing the associated risk and cost of each insurance plan is critical. The objective of this interview challenge is to use UHG's provided data to construct a predictive risk model, enhancing UHG's decision-making and potentially leading to more personalized insurance solutions.

## 3. Questions

#### **Answer 3.1.**
Creating risk categories for insurance plans requires analysis of a variety of factors related to the insured individuals and their claims history. The main aim is to quantify the likelihood and potential cost of a claim for each plan. Here are the factors I would consider for this classification:

1. **Demographic Data**: Age and gender of the insured individuals can influence the risk category. For example, older individuals are generally more likely to file claims than younger ones. Gender can also influence the type and frequency of claims.

2. **Health Status**: If an individual has a chronic disease, they are more likely to file claims, making plans with a higher number of individuals with chronic diseases riskier.

3. **Claim History**: The frequency and amount of past claims can greatly affect the risk category. Plans with a history of frequent or high-cost claims would be considered high risk.

4. **Plan Characteristics**: The characteristics of the plan itself, such as the premium, deductible, and out-of-pocket max, can also influence the risk. Plans with lower premiums and higher out-of-pocket max might be less risky as the insured individuals bear more of the cost.

The following steps can be followed for the risk classification:

1. **Data Integration**: Merge the 'UserData' and 'ClaimData' with 'PlanData' based on 'plan_id' to get a comprehensive dataset for analysis.

2. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features like average claim amount per plan, claim frequency per plan, percentage of insured with chronic diseases per plan, average age per plan etc.

3. **Classification**: Based on the created features, classify the plans into risk categories such as low, medium, and high risk. This can be done using domain knowledge or statistical techniques like clustering.

#### **Answer 3.2.**
The SQL query used here is performing a group-by operation on the 'ClaimData' table. This operation groups the data in the table based on the 'user_id' and 'plan_id' columns. For each unique combination of 'user_id' and 'plan_id', the query sums the 'claim_amount' to generate a new variable 'total_claim_amount'.

#### **Answer 3.3.**
We could use data-driven techniques to guide the feature selection process. Here are a few methods that could be used:

- **Correlation analysis**: This would help us identify which features are most strongly correlated with the target variable 'total_claim_amount'. This is especially useful for numeric features.

- **Feature importance from a tree-based model**: Tree-based models like Random Forest or XGBoost can provide us with a measure of feature importance, which tells us which features were most useful in making accurate predictions.


#### **Answer 3.4.**
For this task, I would recommend using a Gradient Boosting Regressor, which is a powerful ensemble learning algorithm that builds several decision trees and aggregates them to generate a final prediction. This model can handle both numerical and categorical variables and is also less prone to overfitting compared to other regression models, making it a solid choice for this scenario.

Our goal is to estimate the 'total_claim_amount', which is a continuous variable, so a regression model is appropriate. Gradient boosting is a flexible approach, which can capture complex patterns in the data, and it also provides robustness to outliers, which is a beneficial property in the context of claim prediction.

In terms of hyperparameter optimization, I will use Randomized Search CV for tuning the hyperparameters. This method searches a subset of the hyperparameters space, saving computation time compared to GridSearchCV, which exhaustively considers all parameter combinations.

Let's proceed with splitting our data, model training, and hyperparameter tuning:


#### **Answer 3.5.**
To assess the performance of our model in predicting the 'total_claim_amount', we can use several evaluation metrics commonly used for regression tasks. The choice of metrics depends on the specific requirements of the business problem and the desired trade-off between different aspects of model performance. Here, I will suggest using three common regression evaluation metrics:

- **R-squared (R2)**: R2 represents the proportion of the variance in the target variable that is predictable from the input features. It provides an indication of how well the model captures the variability of the target variable, with higher values indicating better performance.

- **Adjusted R-squared**: Adjusted R-squared takes into account the number of predictors in the model and adjusts R-squared accordingly. It penalizes the inclusion of irrelevant predictors and provides a more conservative estimate of the model's explanatory power.

- **Explained Variance Score**: Explained Variance Score calculates the proportion of the variance in the target variable that can be explained by the model. It is similar to R-squared but scaled between 0 and 1, with 1 indicating a perfect fit.
