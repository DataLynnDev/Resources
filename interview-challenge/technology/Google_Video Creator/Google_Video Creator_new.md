# Business Problem Statement:
In the world of YouTube, retaining video creators who consistently generate high-quality content is key to maintaining a dynamic and engaged audience base. Our challenge is to predict whether a creator will be successful enough to continue creating content on YouTube (and thereby avoid "churn"). This classification problem is to determine whether a video creator will earn enough revenue to continue their content creation on YouTube.

## Data Challenge Questions

### 1. **"Video Engagement and Revenue Correlation (SQL/Python)"**

   Investigate any observable trends or patterns in the 'VideoData' and 'RevenueData' tables that might contribute to a creator's revenue. Consider aspects such as views, likes, dislikes, and comments. Craft an SQL query or Python script that quantifies these patterns or correlations.

### 2. **"Unearthing Creator Engagement Levels" (Python)**

   Analyzing the 'CreatorBehaviorData' table, imagine a system to define creators' level of engagement. What behaviors would you focus on and how would you classify these? Provide your rationale and develop a Python script to generate this new feature.

### 3. **"Tracking Revenue Trends (SQL/Python)"**

   Utilizing the 'RevenueData' table, how would you keep track of the fluctuating creator earnings? Can you conceive of a mechanism to record the change in their income over time? Explain your thought process and devise a Python or SQL script that implements this mechanism.

### 4. **"Content Type and Its Effect on Performance (Python)"**

   Reviewing the 'ContentTypeData' table, what insights can you draw about the influence of content type on a video's performance? Can you propose any new measures or metrics that could highlight this impact more clearly? Construct a Python script to create these proposed measures.

### 5. **"Synthesizing Creator Engagement and Revenue Trend (Python)"**

   Integrating the findings from the first three tasks, can you deduce a connection between the creator's engagement level, their videos' performance, and the trend in their earnings? Illustrate this association using Python.

### 6. **"Anticipating Creator Churn (Python)"**

   Utilizing the features and insights derived from the previous tasks, conceive a system to predict a creator's 'ChurnStatus' as described in the 'UserChurn' table. What machine learning model would you opt for and why? Justify your choices, create a Python script to build this model, and evaluate its performance. Lastly, suggest any potential improvements for YouTube's creator retention strategy based on your findings.
