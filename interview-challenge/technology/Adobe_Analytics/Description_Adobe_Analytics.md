# **Business Problem Statement:**
Adobe Analytics is consistently striving to stay at the forefront of understanding user behaviors, preferences, and interactions. However, with the ever-growing inflow of data, it is becoming increasingly challenging to extract meaningful insights in real-time. Your task, as a data scientist, is to dig deep into the analytics data, devise novel strategies to tackle some persistent challenges, and offer insights that can help in enhancing user experience and, in turn, business growth.

## **Data Table**

**UserAnalytics**

| Column Name     | Description                                               | Feature Type   |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| `user_id`         | Unique Identifier for a user                              | Categorical    |
| `session_id`      | Unique Identifier for a session                           | Categorical    |
| `channel`         | Channel used by user (e.g., web, mobile app)              | Categorical    |
| `time_spent`      | Duration (in minutes) spent by the user in a session      | Numerical      |
| `page_views`      | Number of pages viewed in a session                       | Numerical      |
| `click_rate`      | Number of clicks per minute                               | Numerical      |
| `last_activity`   | Last activity timestamp                                   | Timestamp      |
| `conversion_flag` | Whether a session resulted in a purchase (1: Yes, 0: No)  | Binary         |



## **Questions:**

1. **Deep Dive into Channel Preference:**
   
   Given the surge in mobile users, we are keen to understand how different channels impact user behavior. Leveraging the `UserAnalytics` table, can you identify any distinct patterns or insights concerning the duration (`time_spent`) on various channels (`channel`)?
   - *Hint: Consider any potential outliers or seasonal trends.*


2. **Analyzing Conversions with User Behavior:**

   Using the `UserAnalytics` table, how would you gauge the relationship between `click_rate` and `conversion_flag`? Does a higher click rate necessarily translate to a higher likelihood of conversion?



3. **Segmentation for Targeted Marketing:**

   We aim to segment users based on their engagement level, determined by `time_spent` and `page_views`. Using the `UserAnalytics` table, devise a clustering mechanism to segment users into distinct groups. Further, can you hypothesize how each segment might differ in their conversion likelihood (`conversion_flag`)?


4. **Predicting User Conversions:**

   Based on the `UserAnalytics` data, can you develop a predictive model to determine the likelihood of a user converting in their next session? Ensure to delineate the features you'd employ and identify `conversion_flag` as the target variable.

   - *Target Variable:* `conversion_flag`
