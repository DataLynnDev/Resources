# Business Problem Statement:

Apple is considering implementing a new feature in the App Store, that suggests apps based on customers' purchase history and browsing habits. As a data scientist at Apple, your challenge is to develop a predictive model that accurately recommends apps to customers. The two datasets provided consist of customer behavior data and app metadata.

## Data Tables

**Table 1: User_Activity**

Column Name  | Description
-------------------|------------------
UserID (int) | A unique identifier for each user.
AppID (int) | A unique identifier for each app.
Interaction_Type (String) | Describes the type of interaction (e.g., 'Download', 'View', 'Review', 'Uninstall').
Interaction_Time (DateTime) | The timestamp of the interaction.


**Table 2: App_Info**

Column Name  | Description
-------------------|------------------
AppID (int) | A unique identifier for each app (matching the AppID in the User_Activity table).
Category (string) | The category the app belongs to (e.g., 'Productivity', 'Games', 'Health & Fitness').
Release_Date (DateTime) | The date the app was released on the App Store.
Average_Rating (float) | The average user rating of the app (from 1 to 5).
Size_MB (float) | The size of the app in megabytes.
Price (float) | The price of the app.
Downloads (int) | The total number of downloads for the app.

## Questions:

**Q1.** Identify and handle potential outliers in the 'Average_Rating' column: Given that app ratings are typically distributed between 1 and 5, ratings outside of this range could be considered outliers. Moreover, you may consider apps with extremely low ratings (e.g., less than 2) and very few downloads as anomalies, which might need further investigation.

**Q2.** How would you incorporate information about past interactions between the same user and app into the model? How would you design features to capture the effect of time, such as seasonality or trends, on user-app interactions?

**Q3.** Design and implement a basic Linear Regression model: Given the available datasets, outline the process of preparing the data, selecting the features, and building a Linear Regression model to predict the 'Downloads' count for each app. Additionally, describe how you would evaluate the performance of this model.

**Q4.** Construct and interpret an advanced model: Design a Neural Network model to predict the 'Downloads' count. Contrast this model in terms of complexity and interpretability with the models built previously. Incorporate the use of Shapley values to interpret the model's predictions and explain the insights you can glean from these values.
