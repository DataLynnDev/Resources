## Netflix Data Scientist Mock Interview

To develop the fraud detection system, Netflix needs a data scientist who can:

1. Manipulate and analyze large datasets to identify patterns associated with fraudulent activities. This includes using SQL to query data, detect anomalies, and join multiple datasets.

2. Engineer features that can capture the patterns of fraudulent activities. These features could be based on user behavior over time, static account attributes, or a combination of both.

3. Develop a predictive model that can accurately identify potential fraudulent activities. This model should be robust to class imbalance (since fraudulent activities are relatively rare compared to normal user behavior), able to handle concept drift (since the patterns of fraudulent activities may change over time), and be interpretable to non-technical stakeholders.

4. Select the best model among several candidates, considering both their predictive performance and their interpretability. They also need to be able to explain the model's predictions and justify its use to non-technical stakeholders.

5. Translate their findings into actionable business insights. For example, they should be able to recommend strategies to prevent potential fraudulent activities, design experiments to test the effectiveness of these strategies, and communicate the importance and potential ROI of investing in fraud detection to company stakeholders.

## Business Problem
Netflix, as a leading streaming service with millions of subscribers worldwide, faces a significant risk from fraudulent activities. These activities may include identity theft, payment fraud, and misuse of services. Such activities not only lead to financial losses but also undermine user trust and the company's reputation.

To address this issue, Netflix is interested in developing a robust data-driven system that can detect potential fraudulent activities in near real-time. Specifically, they have identified that fraudulent activities often occur in clusters, either in terms of timing (multiple fraudulent actions within a short timeframe) or in terms of geography (fraudulent actions originating from the same or nearby locations).

Netflix has collected extensive user login data, including account IDs, device IDs, login timestamps, payment statuses, session durations, and IP addresses. They have also recorded instances of suspicious activities, such as multiple failed payments, frequent switching between devices, and a large number of logins from different locations.

## Solution Overview

### Data Manipulation

#### Q1_Answer:
We can write an SQL query to filter rows with failed payments, group by account id, and count the number of rows for each account. Here's an example:
```
SELECT Account_ID, COUNT(*) as Failed_Payments
FROM UserActivityTable
WHERE Payment_Status = 'Failed'
GROUP BY Account_ID
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
```

This query will give us a list of account IDs and the number of failed payments for each account with more than one failed payment.

As for the correlation between the number of failed payments and suspicious activity, we can use Python's Pandas library to calculate the correlation:

In this Python code, we first merge the UserActivityTable and FraudTable on Account_ID to combine information about user activities and suspicious activity flags. Then, we filter the rows with failed payments and count the number of failed payments for each account. Finally, we calculate the correlation between the number of failed payments and suspicious activity.

#### Q2_Answer:
We can use Python's Pandas library to calculate login frequencies and session durations for each account:

In this Python code, we calculate the login frequencies and average session durations for each account. We then identify accounts with login frequencies or session durations that are higher than the 99th percentile. These accounts might be considered outliers and could be indicative of automated processes.
#### Q3_Answer:

We can identify such accounts by calculating the number of unique devices for each account:

In this Python code, we calculate the number of unique devices for each account and identify accounts with more unique devices than the 90th percentile. These accounts might be considered as frequently switching between multiple devices.

To check whether these accounts are more likely to show suspicious activity, we can calculate the percentage of them that have suspicious activity flags in the FraudTable:

This Python code calculates the mean of Suspicious_Activity_Flag for the accounts identified as switching accounts. This gives us the percentage of switching accounts that have suspicious activity.
### Feature Engineering

#### Q4_Answer:
This code first sorts the UserActivityTable by Account_ID and Login_TimeStamp. Then it calculates the time between consecutive logins for each account using the diff function, which calculates the difference between consecutive rows in a DataFrame. Finally, it converts the time between logins to minutes for easier interpretation.

#### Q5_Answer:
Features that capture the geographic dispersion of logins can help identify accounts that are being accessed from a wide range of locations, which could be indicative of fraudulent behavior (for example, if an account is being accessed by different people in different locations).

This code calculates the number of unique IP addresses and the range of IP addresses for each account. Please note that the calculation of IP address range is a simplification and assumes that IP addresses are represented as integers. In reality, IP addresses are more complex and you would need a more sophisticated method to calculate geographic dispersion based on IP addresses.
#### Q6_Answer:
A feature capturing the time since the last failed payment could be useful for predicting suspicious activity because it might indicate an account that is having consistent issues with payment - potentially because it's a fraudulent account using stolen or fake payment information.

This code first filters the rows with failed payments. Then it calculates the time since the last failed payment for each account using the diff function. Finally, it converts the time since the last failed payment to days for easier interpretation.

### Modeling and Metrics
#### Q7_Answer:
Here's an approach to handle both types of data:

- Static Attributes: These are straightforward as they can be directly used as features in the model. For example, number of devices used (num_unique_devices) or number of unique IPs (num_unique_IPs).

- Behavioral Patterns Over Time: To incorporate time-series behavioral data like login frequency, we need to engineer suitable features that capture these behaviors. Here are some ideas:

- Login frequency: We can create features such as average number of logins per day, number of logins in the last week/month, etc.
Time since last login: Calculate the time difference between the current login and the previous login.
- Login patterns: Identify any repeating patterns in login times (e.g., user logs in at a particular time of the day or a specific day of the week). This could be done by creating binary features such as "logged in during morning", "logged in on weekends", etc.

Static attributes are fixed properties of an account, such as the number of devices used.

The 'Number_of_Different_Devices_Last_Month' feature already captures this information. We can consider this as a static attribute as long as we're looking at it from a fixed time period.

Now, we can use these features to build a model. We would first need to combine all these features into a single DataFrame:
#### Q8_Answer:
To ensure the model remains effective as new data comes in, it's crucial to have a system in place to retrain the model periodically or when its performance drops.

Periodic retraining can be done on a schedule, like daily, weekly, or monthly, depending on the business needs and the rate at which the data and patterns in it change.

Retraining when performance drops requires setting up a monitoring system to track the model's performance in production. This could be done by maintaining a holdout set of data that the model's predictions are compared against, or by tracking the model's performance on key metrics in production and triggering retraining when these metrics fall below a certain threshold.

Here's an example of how you could set up a system to retrain your model when its accuracy drops below a certain threshold:

In this Python code, a function is defined that takes a model, holdout set, training set, and accuracy threshold as inputs. It calculates the model's accuracy on the holdout set and retrains the model if the accuracy falls below the threshold.
#### Q9_Answer:
In a production setting, the model would need to be deployed as a service that can take in the necessary input data and return a prediction in real time. This could be implemented as a REST API using a framework like Flask or FastAPI in Python.

The process would generally involve:

- Data Collection: Real-time user activity data would need to be collected and stored.
- Feature Engineering: The necessary features would be calculated based on the real-time data.
- Model Prediction: The engineered features would be fed into the model to generate a prediction.
- Action: If the model predicts that the activity is suspicious, a flag would be raised and the relevant team would be alerted.

The model would also need to be retrained periodically with fresh data to ensure that it continues to make accurate predictions as patterns of behavior evolve over time. It's also important to monitor the model's performance to ensure that it's still performing well.

### Model Selection
#### Q10_Answer:
To compare models, we use the login data you've provided. We evaluate models based on Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and AUC-ROC.

Precision is crucial because we don't want to falsely flag customers as fraudulent (False Positives) because that could lead to customer dissatisfaction.

Recall is also important because we want to catch as many fraudulent activities as possible (True Positives).

F1 Score gives a balance between Precision and Recall which is useful when the cost of False Positives and False Negatives are similar.

AUC-ROC is used to measure the model's ability to distinguish between fraudulent and non-fraudulent activities, irrespective of the threshold used.
#### Q11_Answer:
Even complex models like deep learning can be made interpretable with techniques such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). Let's say you've created a model to predict suspicious activity. We can use SHAP to break down a prediction and show the contribution of each feature.
#### Q12_Answer:
The decision between model complexity and interpretability is a balancing act and depends on the requirements of the task. For fraud detection, high accuracy is important as fraudulent activities can lead to considerable financial loss. However, interpretability is also crucial. For instance, being able to interpret the model would allow us to understand why an account is flagged as suspicious. This understanding can lead to improved customer communication and even help in devising strategies to counter fraudulent activities.

Depending on the business needs, a model such as Random Forest could be a good choice because it provides a good balance between accuracy and interpretability. It's usually more interpretable than a deep learning model (since it can rank feature importance), while still being able to capture complex patterns in the data.

### Business Insight
#### Q13_Answer:
Based on the findings, Netflix can implement several strategies to reduce fraudulent activity:

a. Enhanced User Verification: For accounts that display suspicious behavior such as frequent logins, multiple devices, and failed payments, additional verification procedures can be implemented, such as two-factor authentication.

b. Adaptive Monitoring: The system can actively monitor users that have shown signs of suspicious behavior and flag any sudden changes for review.

c. Advanced Alerts: Alerts can be set up for sudden spikes in the frequency of logins, especially from new devices or locations. This would allow immediate action to be taken to prevent potential fraud.

d. Machine Learning Models: Implement ML models to predict fraudulent activity. The models can be used in real-time to assess the likelihood of a login being fraudulent and take immediate action if required.
#### Q14_Answer:
If the analysis reveals certain patterns in time, such as fraudulent activity spiking at specific times of the day or days of the week, this information can be highly valuable. Increased surveillance and stricter verification procedures could be implemented during these times. Additionally, machine learning models could be trained to give more weight to these time periods while predicting fraudulent activity.
#### Q15_Answer:
Fraud detection is essential for maintaining the trust and satisfaction of Netflix's user base. Stakeholders need to understand that without adequate fraud detection mechanisms, the company could suffer from financial losses, reputational damage, and decreased user trust.

To quantify the potential return on investment, one could calculate the costs associated with fraud, including money lost through fraudulent transactions, resources spent on managing fraud incidents, and potential revenue lost due to damaged customer relationships. The effectiveness of the model in reducing these costs could be translated into a potential return on investment.

For example, if the model reduces the amount of fraud by 20%, and we estimate that fraud costs the company \$10 million a year, then the model could be seen as providing a potential saving of $2 million a year.

Remember, effective communication should involve clear language, visual aids where possible, and a strong emphasis on the benefits and potential return.
