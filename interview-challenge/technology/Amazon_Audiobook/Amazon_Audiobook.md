## **Business Problem Statement**

The Audiobook team at Amazon is planning to optimize their recommendation engine and customer behavior prediction models. The team wants to understand the patterns in customer's audiobook listening behaviors, their preferences, and what type of content leads to more engagement. The ultimate goal is to enhance customer experience, increase sales, and reduce churn rate.

We have access to two primary databases:
1. **User_Info**: This contains user demographic information.
2. **Listening_History**: This stores the data related to the audiobooks listened to by each user, along with their listening details.

## **Data Tables**

1. **Table: User_Info**
   - *user_id*: unique identifier for each user
   - *age*: age of the user
   - *gender*: gender of the user
   - *location*: location of the user
   - *profession*: profession of the user
   
2. **Table: Listening_History**
   - *user_id*: unique identifier for each user
   - *audiobook_id*: unique identifier for each audiobook
   - *genre*: genre of the audiobook
   - *length*: length of the audiobook in minutes
   - *completion*: percentage of the audiobook listened to by the user
   - *timestamp*: when the user listened to the audiobook

## **Questions**

1. Based on the user's age, gender, location, and profession from the User_Info table and their listening history (genres and completion rate) from the Listening_History table, construct a supervised machine learning model to predict whether a user will complete an audiobook or not. How would you validate the performance of your model? Discuss the choice of your algorithm and its applicability in this business case.

2. Given the different professions and genders, calculate the probability of a user completing at least one audiobook in the last month. How would you estimate the probability of a new user (not in our dataset) completing an audiobook?
   
3. How would you preprocess and structure the data from both tables for time series analysis? Given that we want to understand the user's audiobook listening trend, write a SQL query to create a new table that shows monthly listening statistics for each user. Include columns for user_id, month, total length of audiobooks listened to, total number of audiobooks completed, and favorite genre (the genre the user listened to the most in that month).

4. Amazon wants to experiment with voice-driven recommendations. As a data scientist, how would you use Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technology to enhance the current recommendation system?
