# **Business Problem Statement**:
FaceID and Animoji's success depend largely on the accurate detection and mapping of a user's facial landmarks. The ability to differentiate between distinct users while also recognizing the minute details that allow the Animoji to imitate facial movements ensures the user's security and entertainment. The primary challenge lies in the accurate detection of facial landmarks, recognizing nuances in expressions, and the generalization across diverse users. For this, we constantly need to improve our models and techniques. We're looking to hire a Data Scientist who can leverage their experience to help further this initiative.

## **Data Tables**:

1. **UserFacialData Table**:

| Column Name | Description | Feature Type |
|---|---|---|
| UserID | Unique identifier for each user | Categorical |
| FacialPoints | X, Y, Z coordinates of facial landmarks | Continuous |
| Timestamp | Timestamp of the data capture | DateTime |

2. **UserExpressions & ProductInteractions Table**:

| Column Name | Description | Feature Type |
|---|---|---|
| UserID | Unique identifier for each user | Categorical |
| ExpressionType (UserExpressions only) | Type of facial expression (e.g., smile, frown) | Categorical |
| ExpressionStrength (UserExpressions only) | Strength of the expression (0-1 scale) | Continuous |
| Product (ProductInteractions only) | FaceID or Animoji | Categorical |
| InteractionTime (ProductInteractions only) | Duration of user interaction in seconds | Continuous |

## **Questions**:

1. **Facial Point Consistency**: Considering the `UserFacialData` table, for a given user, determine the variance in their FacialPoints over a specified period. How consistent are the facial landmarks? Use this information to identify any anomalies or outliers which might indicate sensor errors or other inconsistencies.

    
2. **Expression Correlation**: Using the `UserExpressions` table, can you group users based on similarities in their ExpressionType and ExpressionStrength? What patterns emerge for users predominantly using Animoji versus those primarily using FaceID from the `ProductInteractions` table?

3. **Product Interaction Time Series**: Given the `ProductInteractions` table, predict the future InteractionTime for a user with the product. How do their interactions change over time? Use this to anticipate and optimize user experience.

    
4. **A/B Testing for Animoji Enhancement**: Imagine Apple introduces a new set of enhanced Animoji features. Using the data from `UserExpressions` and `ProductInteractions`, how would you set up an A/B test to determine if these new features lead to more accurate expression mappings and longer interaction times?
