## Business Problem Statement:

Google's Email Services team is interested in optimizing the performance and reliability of its Gmail service. An essential part of this process is identifying potential service disruptions proactively. Therefore, your task is to classify Gmail users into 'High_Risk', 'Medium_Risk' and 'Low_Risk' groups based on their interaction and usage patterns. This classification will help devise strategies that enhance service efficiency, minimize disruptions, and increase user satisfaction.

## Data Challenge Questions

### **1. "Statistical Profiling of Risk Groups in Gmail Users"**

Given Gmail's plethora of services, we observe unique interaction patterns among its users. With reference to the 'GmailUsageData' and 'GmailUserData' tables, could you statistically profile these user categories? Potential metrics may encompass email transmission frequency, chat interactions, login consistency, and accumulated email volume. Could you articulate the defining features of each group and the methodological approach employed to segment them?

### **2. "Correlational Analysis Between User Activities and Gmail Service Disruptions"**

Service interruptions may emerge from diverse sources, some potentially linked to user activities. Employing the 'GmailServiceDisruptionData' table, could you extract any associations between user activity patterns and service disruptions? Provide a correlation interpretation which could assist in user risk stratification and propose potential enhancements to the 'RiskGroup' classification according to your analysis.

### **3. "Infusion of External Tech Trends into Risk Group Analytics"**

External IT trends such as the escalation of data volume, cybersecurity threats, and shifts in technology adoption rates can mold user behavior and engagement with services. What methodology would you utilize to amalgamate this external data with our 'GmailUserData'? Give an analytic overview of how these external influencers could modify the risk profile of each user group, and any consequential recalibration required in the 'RiskGroup' classification.


### **4. "Investigation of Regional and Activity-Based Disruption Patterns"**
Service disruption patterns may vary across different user activities and geographical territories. By analyzing data from the 'GmailServiceDisruptionData' and 'GmailUserData' tables, could you investigate these patterns using statistical tools and techniques? Consider factors such as timing, frequency, and severity of disruptions. Rather than establishing correlation, focus on the descriptive statistics and visualizations that highlight any observable trends or patterns.

### **5. "Feature Engineering for Predictive Modeling"**
In preparation for creating a predictive model for 'RiskGroup' categorization, it's crucial to identify and engineer the right features. Analyze the 'GmailUserData' table and extract or create variables that may contribute to the risk profile of a user. This could involve generating new data attributes from existing ones, dealing with missing values, outliers, or applying transformations for improving model performance. Discuss your approach, rationale, and methods for feature engineering.

### **6. "Building a Predictive Model for Risk Group Categorization"**

Drawing on the insights and features you derived from preceding tasks, which variables would you flag as potential predictors for the 'RiskGroup' of Gmail users? How would you architect a predictive model that incorporates these features? Provide a methodological overview of how you would safeguard your model against overfitting. Based on the performance of your model, what potential amendments could be made to Gmail service optimization strategies to further enhance user satisfaction?
