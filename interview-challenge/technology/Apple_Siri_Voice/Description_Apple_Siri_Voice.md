# **Business Problem Statement**:

Apple's Siri, our flagship voice-activated personal assistant, needs to be further enhanced in understanding user context, especially in differentiating between the myriad of accents, regional phrases, and colloquialisms from all over the world. As we expand Siri's linguistic reach, our goal is to ensure Siri comprehends and responds to global users more efficiently while minimizing misunderstandings.

For this, Apple has collected extensive voice data from various regions. The data is categorized by regional accents, type of command (e.g., setting reminders, asking questions, sending messages), and more. As a prospective data scientist, your challenge is to delve deep into this data, glean insights, and make impactful suggestions for Siri's enhancement.


## Data Table

**SiriVoiceLogs:**

| Column Name | Description                                             | Feature Type     |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| UserID      | Unique Identifier for each user                         | Categorical      |
| Command     | Type of command given to Siri                           | Categorical      |
| DateTime    | Date and Time the command was given                     | DateTime         |
| Region      | Geographic region of the user                           | Categorical      |
| Accent      | Specific accent of the user                             | Categorical      |
| Success     | Whether Siri successfully understood the command (0/1) | Binary           |
| Device      | The Apple device used (iPhone, iPad, Mac)               | Categorical      |
| Feedback    | User feedback if Siri misunderstood (optional)          | Textual (optional)|



## **Questions**:

1. **Data Manipulation & Cleaning:**  
Scenario: During a preliminary analysis, you noticed that some of the `DateTime` entries in the SiriVoiceLogs table were entered as mere dates without time. Using Python and the dataframes, please clean these records and assume a standard time for them. Additionally, for accents with less than 100 entries, label them as 'Others'.


2. **Probability and Statistics:**  
Scenario: Given the immense diversity in accents, you wonder how consistent Siri's success rate is across various regions and accents. Can you construct a confidence interval for the success rate of Siri's understanding for each major accent in the dataset?


3. **Machine Learning & Modeling:**  
Scenario: Apple is very keen on understanding how different devices might influence Siri's comprehension. Train a classification model using relevant features to predict the `Success` column. Evaluate your model's performance using a confusion matrix and other metrics. What insights can you derive from your model regarding Siri's performance across different devices?


4. **Product Design & Analytics:**  
Scenario: Siri's team has recently made a software update aiming to improve Siri's understanding of certain regional accents. Using the data post the update timestamp (assume a date for this scenario), can you design an A/B test to assess if the update has indeed improved Siri's performance for these specific accents?
