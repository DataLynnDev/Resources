# **Business Problem Statement:**
Apple's Photos app offers features like intelligent search and automated Memories, which leverage data science and machine learning to enhance the user experience. Your task is to improve and validate the model's accuracy and robustness while also developing new features to increase user engagement. The primary dataset, named `Photos_info`, contains a rich set of user interactions, photo metadata, and system-generated tags.

## Data Table

**Photos_info**

| Column Name   | Description                                    | Feature Type     |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| photo_id      | Unique identifier for each photo               | Categorical      |
| timestamp     | Time when the photo was taken or uploaded      | Datetime         |
| location      | GPS coordinates where the photo was taken      | Continuous       |
| object_tags   | Machine-generated tags for objects in the photo| Text (List)      |
| memory_status | Whether the photo is part of a memory or not   | Binary (0 or 1)  |
| search_count  | Number of times the photo appeared in searches | Continuous       |
| view_count    | Number of times the photo was viewed           | Continuous       |

## **Questions:**

1. **Contextual Analysis:** Given the `Photos_info`, extract the top 5 most common object tags associated with photos taken in a specific location of your choice (NYC for example: latitude between 38 and 42, and longitude between -76 and -72). How does this information align with the expected objects in that location?

2. **Model Evaluation:** The user have reported that some photos are incorrectly tagged by our system. From `Photos_info`, select photos where `search_count` is high but `view_count` is considerably low (e.g., below a threshold). These can be instances where users might not have found what they were looking for due to incorrect tagging. Describe a statistical test to validate this hypothesis.

3. **Segmentation Analysis:** Using the `Photos_info` dataset, cluster the photos based on their `timestamp` and `location` to suggest potential new "Memories" themes. For instance, photos taken during summer vacations or winter holidays in distinct locations. How can these clusters enhance the user experience in the Memories feature?

4. **Advanced Feature Development:** Propose a new feature for the Photos app that leverages the object tags and user interaction data (e.g., search_count) from `Photos_info` to increase user engagement. Additionally, describe a machine learning model, mentioning independent and dependent variables, to implement this feature.
