# **Business Problem Statement:**
Oracle's Data Security team is determined to improve and reinforce data protection mechanisms. To achieve this, the team wishes to employ advanced data science techniques to identify potential vulnerabilities, ensure data access patterns are as expected, and predict potential breaches based on various indicators. For this purpose, we want to assess the capability of potential candidates in utilizing data science to address data security challenges.

## **Data Table:**

| average_access_time | Average time a user spends per access                         | Continuous        |
| access_frequency    | Number of times user accesses a resource in a week             | Continuous        |
| previous_breach     | Whether the user has previously been involved in a data breach | Binary (0 or 1)   |

### **Questions:**

1. **Scenario:** Given the `user_id`, `resource_id`, and `access_timestamp`, one of our security mechanisms is to track the frequency and average time users spend on specific resources to identify any anomaly.  
   
   **Question:** Using the `access_frequency` and `average_access_time`, identify which users exhibit access patterns that deviate by more than 20% from their usual behavior in the past month. (View the latest date in the data as "Today")
   

2. **Scenario:** There is a hypothesis that users accessing resources from new or unknown locations or devices might indicate a security breach or at least a reason to be vigilant.
   
   **Question:** From the `location`, `device_signature`, and `previous_breach` columns, can you develop a model to predict the `red_flags` generated by the system? Indicate which feature is the target variable and explain the feature importance.
   
   *Target Variable:* `red_flags`  

3. **Scenario:** Oracle's data resources can have patterns in access types. For example, a write access might commonly be followed by multiple read accesses.
   
   **Question:** Using the `access_type` and `access_timestamp` columns, analyze the sequence of access types in the past week for any unusual patterns not seen in the past six months. (View the latest date in the data as "Today")
