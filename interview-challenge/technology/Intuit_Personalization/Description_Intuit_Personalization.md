# **Business Problem Statement:**
Intuit's Personalization team aims to enhance user experience by tailoring product recommendations and features according to individual user preferences, spending habits, and financial behaviors. With this in mind, the ultimate goal is to provide customers with valuable insights, such as suggesting pertinent tax deductions in TurboTax or furnishing tailored business suggestions in QuickBooks. However, while the intentions are clear, deciphering patterns from vast data and turning it into actionable intelligence is a challenging endeavor. This data challenge will gauge the ability of a data scientist to maneuver through complex data sets, derive meaningful patterns, and suggest actionable strategies for personalization.

## **Questions:**

1. **Scenario:** You are given data from two tables: User_Profile and Transaction_History. Start by investigating if there's any correlation between the `age_group` of a user and the `product_purchased`.
    - Construct a SQL query to retrieve the most popular product purchased for each age group.

2. **Scenario:** Intuit is interested in understanding the patterns around user engagement with the platform. Specifically, they're curious if users who view more products tend to act on the recommendations provided.
    - Using the `product_viewed` and `recommendation` columns, determine the probability that a user who has viewed more than 5 products in the last month will click on a recommendation. Apply your statistical knowledge to infer significance.

3. **Scenario:** Intuit wants to identify potential high-value users to offer them special deals. High-value users are characterized by their spending habits and frequent purchases.
    - Create a machine learning model with `spending_habit` as the feature and `purchase_value` as the target variable to predict the value of a user's next purchase. Briefly describe your choice of algorithm and any preprocessing steps you would take.

4. **Scenario:** Based on user behavior, Intuit wants to rank products in order of relevance when making recommendations. However, they are unsure of the features to consider for this ranking.
    - Describe a system that would rank products based on user interaction data and transaction history. Consider both User_Profile and Transaction_History tables for your inputs. How would you validate the effectiveness of this ranking system?
