## 3. Questions for the Data Challenge

<!-- **1. Lifecycle Segmentation and Classification:**

Given the 'SalesData', 'CustomerFeedback', and 'ProductSpecs' tables, how would you develop a robust classification system to segment Apple hardware products into lifecycle stages? What variables would you consider as pivotal in defining each stage, and how would they contribute to the unique characteristics of these stages? -->

**1. Uncovering Drivers of Customer Satisfaction:**

How does the lifecycle stage of a product affect its customer ratings? Do newly introduced products receive higher ratings than products in their maturity or decline stages?

**2. Interpreting the Relationship between Product Specifications and Sales:**

How would you investigate the influence of product specifications on sales trends across different lifecycle stages? In cases of sparse data for certain specs, how would you handle the lack of robustness in the data to maintain the integrity of your analysis?

**3. Analyzing Supply Chain Efficiency Across Lifecycle Stages:**

Can you build a PySpark solution to analyze supply chain efficiency across different lifecycle stages, correlating these efficiencies with sales trends and customer satisfaction? How would you use these findings to inform business strategies?

**4. Impact of Product Evolution on Lifecycle Stages:**

How do changes in product specifications over time, such as storage capacity, screen size, and battery life, affect a product's lifecycle stage? Can you design a method to quantify the effect of these evolving specifications on product lifecycle transitions?

**5. Predictive Modelling for Lifecycle Stages:**

How would you design and implement a predictive model that uses the insights and features derived from the previous steps to predict lifecycle stages? How would you validate this model and ensure its generalizability to avoid overfitting? What potential impacts and outcomes could we expect when applying this model in real-world scenarios?

**6. Real-Time Lifecycle Management Strategy:**

Given the predictive model you built, how can you use real-time data to continuously update and improve lifecycle predictions? Can you suggest a strategy to ensure our lifecycle management remains data-driven, accurate, and up-to-date, even as new data comes in?
