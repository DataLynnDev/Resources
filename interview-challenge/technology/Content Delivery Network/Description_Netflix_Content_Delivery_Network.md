# **Business Problem Statement:**

Netflix's Content Delivery Network (CDN) is the backbone of delivering high-quality streaming content to users worldwide. It's imperative to continuously monitor, analyze, and optimize the CDN's performance to ensure a seamless viewing experience. In this context, we are faced with three critical areas of analysis:

1. Performance Metrics: Assessing the CDN's content load times across varying regions, times, and content types to identify performance disparities and improvement areas.
2. Traffic Analysis: Understanding the system's usage patterns, identifying bottlenecks, and detecting potential vulnerabilities to ensure uninterrupted service.
3. Cost-Benefit Analysis: Evaluating the costs associated with CDN maintenance or upgrades against the benefits derived from enhanced performance and reduced user complaints.

## **Data Tables:**

Table 1: **CDN_Logs**

Table 2: **CDN_Costs**

| Feature Name   | Brief Feature Description         | Feature Data Type | Comments                             |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------|
| cost_id        | Unique cost identifier           | int               | Primary Key                           |
| region         | Geographic region                 | varchar           |                                       |
| upgrade_cost   | Cost of CDN upgrade               | float             |                                       |
| maintenance_cost| Cost of CDN maintenance         | float             |                                       |
| month          | Month of the cost incurred       | date              |                                       |

## **SQL Questions:**

1. **Scenario:** The CDN_Logs table has recently been populated with new data. However, the content_type column entries have been inconsistently formatted. Standardizing these entries is crucial for accurate analysis.

   **Task:** Write a query to format the content_type column such that only the first letter is uppercase, and the rest are lowercase.

2. **Scenario:** Our CDN experiences varying load times. Identifying regions and content types with significantly higher load times can help prioritize optimization efforts.

   **Task:** Write a query to identify the regions and content types where the average load time is more than 2 seconds. Provide the average load time for each of these combinations and order the result by region, then by content type.

3. **Scenario:** To perform a cost-benefit analysis, understanding the costs incurred in different regions and correlating them with performance metrics is essential.

   **Task:** Write a query to calculate the total costs (sum of upgrade_cost and maintenance_cost) for each region from the CDN_Costs table. Join this with the previous queryâ€™s result to show the average load time alongside the total costs for each region and content type, ordering the result by total costs in descending order.
