# Business Problem Statement:
Apple's Health app and Apple Watch are critical tools for collecting, analyzing, and sharing health and medical data. However, identifying trends and providing personalized insights to users to enhance their health and wellness has become a growing need. The goal is to analyze users' health data from multiple sources, detect patterns, develop predictive models, and design innovative solutions that can provide personalized health recommendations and facilitate clinical studies.

## Data Table:

| Column Name        | Description                                        | Feature Type  |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| user_id            | Unique identifier for a user                       | Categorical   |
| age                | Age of the user                                    | Numerical     |
| gender             | Gender of the user                                 | Categorical   |
| activity_level     | Daily activity level (Low, Medium, High)           | Categorical   |
| heart_rate         | Heart rate recorded by Apple Watch                 | Numerical     |
| sleep_hours        | Number of hours slept                              | Numerical     |
| calories_burned    | Calories burned during physical activities         | Numerical     |
| medical_condition  | Medical condition if any (e.g., Diabetes)          | Categorical   |
| medication_usage   | Information about medication usage                 | Categorical   |


## Questions:

1. *Scenario*: Apple wants to introduce a new feature to predict the likelihood of a certain medical condition based on lifestyle and health data.

   **Question**: Using the given data, describe how you would model the probability of a specific medical condition (e.g., Diabetes) occurrence for different age groups. What statistical methods would you apply, and how would you interpret the confidence interval for your predictions?

2. *Scenario*: The team is interested in understanding user behavior and predicting future activity levels.

   **Question**: Based on the available features, design a machine learning model to predict the `activity_level` of users. Clearly mark `activity_level` as the target variable. Explain the metrics you would use for model evaluation and how you would handle bias-variance tradeoff.
