## Apple Data Scientist Mock Interview

### Business Problem Statement:
In Apple Music, we aim to constantly improve and tailor our user's experiences to their preferences. We use vast amounts of data generated by user interactions to identify patterns, behaviors, and preferences to drive our recommendation system, marketing strategy, user engagement, and more. In this data challenge, we would like you to address a key business problem - How can we predict user churn, and what factors contribute most to a user's likelihood to discontinue using Apple Music? Further, how can we leverage these insights to proactively target users at risk of churning and improve their experience?

To help you in this task, we provide two interrelated datasets:

1. User Data Table (Static)

Column Name  | Description
-------------------|------------------
User_id	|Unique identifier for the user
Registration_date	| Date of user registration
Device_type	| Type of device the user is registered on
Subscription_type	|Type of the user's subscription (Family, Individual, Student)
User_age |	Age of the user
User_gender	| Gender of the user
User_country	| Country of user

This table represents static information about a user.

2. Activity Data Table (Dynamic)

Column Name  | Description
-------------------|------------------
User_id	|Unique identifier for the user
Date	|Date of the activity
Total_listening_time|	Total time spent on listening music
Songs_played|	Number of songs played
Unique_artists_played	|Number of unique artists listened to
Playlist_created|	Number of playlists created
Followed_artist|	Number of artists followed
Skipped_songs|	Number of songs skipped
Churn_flag|	Whether the user has churned or not (1 = Yes, 0 = No)

This table represents dynamic user activity data on a daily basis.


### Data Manipulation:

#### Q1_Answer:

First, I would identify the set of users who have churned and check their activity on weekdays in the past month. For those who weren't active on weekdays, I would further examine the regional distribution. If this pattern is not uniform across regions, it suggests that regional factors (perhaps cultural or based on regional market trends) might be playing a role.

This observation could lead to the creation of a new feature - 'Inactive_weekdays'. This binary feature would indicate whether a user was inactive on weekdays in the past month. However, since this pattern is not uniform across regions, we should interact this feature with 'User_country' to capture the regional differences.

#### Q2_Answer:

Consider the rate of change in the 'Total_listening_time', which may indicate the recent trend in a user's activity level. A decreasing trend might indicate that a user is losing interest and could be more likely to churn.

### Feature Engineering:

#### Q3_Answer:

It requires the creation of a new feature, 'Average_song_length', by dividing the 'Total_listening_time' by 'Songs_played'. The idea behind this feature is that the average length of songs a user listens to could be indicative of their music preference or listening habits, which in turn could be related to their likelihood to churn. For example, users who listen to longer songs (such as podcasts or concerts) may be more engaged and less likely to churn compared to users who listen to shorter songs or skip songs frequently.

### Model:

#### Q4_Answer:

This code uses machine learning to predict customer churn, or whether a customer will stop doing business with a company, based on some activity and user data. It applies preprocessing techniques on the data, balances the classes using SMOTE, splits the data into a training and test set, and standardizes the features.

Two machine learning models, Logistic Regression and Random Forest, are trained on the data. These models are then used to predict customer churn on the test data.

The performance of the models is evaluated using several metrics, including ROC AUC, precision, recall, and F1 score. Confusion matrices for the models' predictions are also computed. Finally, these metrics and matrices are printed out for analysis.

#### Q5_Answer:

This piece of code is computing and displaying the feature importance, or the relative importance of input variables, for the two models used in the previous code: Logistic Regression and Random Forest.

First, it retrieves the names of the features used in the model.

For Logistic Regression, the feature importance is computed as the absolute value of the coefficients. In Logistic Regression, the magnitude of the coefficients can be indicative of the importance of the features.

For the Random Forest model, feature importance is computed directly, as Random Forests models have built-in methods to calculate this.

The feature importance is then stored in two dataframes, one for each model, alongside the corresponding feature names. The dataframes are sorted in descending order based on the importance of the features.

Finally, it prints out the top 10 most important features for both Logistic Regression and Random Forest models. These are the features that contribute most to the predictions of the respective models.

### Business Insight:

#### Q6_Answer:
Based on the churn prediction model, here are some proactive measures that Apple Music can consider:

1. For users that the model identifies as high risk for churning, Apple Music could send personalized offers or discounts to encourage continued use. These offers could be tailored based on the user's preferences and behaviors.

2. If the model suggests that certain behaviors, like skipping songs often or not creating playlists, are associated with a higher risk of churn, Apple Music could introduce features or tutorials that encourage these behaviors. For example, Apple Music could recommend playlists for users to follow or improve their song recommendation algorithm to reduce song skipping.

3. If the model finds that users who listen to a wider variety of artists are less likely to churn, Apple Music could develop features to promote discovery of new artists and songs.

4. The approach to retention can be personalized based on user characteristics. For example, younger users might be more receptive to social features, like sharing playlists, while older users might appreciate features that help them discover new music within genres that they enjoy.

#### Q7_Answer:

To distinguish itself from competitors and reduce churn, Apple Music could focus on the following areas:

1. Personalization: If the churn model identifies that users who engage with more personalized features (like following artists or creating playlists) are less likely to churn, Apple Music could invest in improving its personalization algorithms and features.

2. User Interface and Experience: If a significant portion of users are found to churn due to difficulties navigating the app or using its features, it would be worth investing in improving the user interface and experience.

3. Exclusive Content: Apple Music could negotiate deals for exclusive releases or content from popular artists, which could help to attract and retain users.

4. Pricing Models: Depending on the subscription type's impact on churn, Apple Music could explore different pricing models or discounts. For example, if family plans have lower churn, they could offer promotions to encourage more users to switch to this plan.

5. Market-Specific Strategies: If the churn model finds that users in certain countries or regions are more likely to churn, Apple Music could investigate the reasons and develop strategies to address these market-specific issues. For example, they could offer content that is more tailored to the local music preferences in these markets.
