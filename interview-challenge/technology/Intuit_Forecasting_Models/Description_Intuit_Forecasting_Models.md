# Business Problem Statement:
*Intuit aims to improve its forecasting models to help businesses and individuals plan more effectively for their financial futures. The objective is to refine the predictions for sales for businesses and future expenses or savings growth for individuals. To achieve this, we need a data scientist with a holistic skill set spanning data manipulation, statistical analysis, machine learning, and an understanding of product design.*

## Questions:

1. **Data Manipulation & Cleaning**:
   - *Scenario:* Given the current table, identify and clean any potential anomalies or outliers in the `sales` and `expenses` for each `quarter`. What strategy would you apply?

2. **Probability and Statistics**:
   - *Scenario:* Analyzing the sales of different businesses, if you find that the sales of one business in `Q2` is significantly higher than other businesses, what statistical test would you employ to ascertain if this difference is statistically significant? Additionally, assuming a binomial distribution, estimate the probability that a randomly picked business will surpass its sales in the next `quarter`.
     
3. **Machine Learning & Modeling**:
   - *Scenario:* Design a predictive model to forecast the `sales` of a business for the next `quarter`. Given the current features in the data table, what additional derived features would you consider? Also, explain your choice of model and how you would validate its performance.
     
     *Note: The target variable here is `sales`.*

4. **Product Design & Analytics**:
   - *Scenario:* Based on the `monthly_savings` and `monthly_expenses` of individuals (`user_id`), design a product feature that would offer personalized financial advice to users. What metrics would you consider to measure the success of this feature?
