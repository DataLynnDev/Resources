# Business Problem Statement

Uber seeks to refine its ride-matching algorithm to ensure optimal experiences for both riders and drivers, especially during peak hours and on event days. With competitors in the market, enhancing the efficiency of our ride-matching process can provide a significant advantage. The objective is to delve deep into this aspect of our service, exploring factors that can make ride-matching more efficient and timely, reduce waiting times, and improve rider and driver satisfaction.

## Data Tables

**1. Rides**

| Column Name      | Description                                  | Feature Type  |

| Timestamp        | Time when the ride was booked                | DateTime      |
| Rider_ID         | ID of the customer                           | Categorical   |
| Driver_ID        | ID of the driver                             | Categorical   |
| Origin           | Start location of the ride                   | Text          |
| Destination      | End location of the ride                     | Text          |


**2. Drivers**  

| Column Name      | Description                                  | Feature Type  |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------|
| Driver_ID        | Unique identifier for each driver            | Categorical   |
| Rating           | Average rating of the driver                 | Numeric       |
| Total_Rides      | Total number of rides taken by the driver    | Numeric       |

**3. Events**   

| Column Name      | Description                                  | Feature Type  |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------|
| Event_ID         | Unique identifier for a major event          | Categorical   |
| Event_Name       | Name of the event                            | Text          |
| Event_Date       | Date of the event                            | DateTime      |
| Expected_Attendance | Expected number of attendees for the event | Numeric     |

**Questions:**

1. **Demand Surge Analysis:** Using the `Rides` and `Events` tables, determine the percentage increase in ride requests on the days of major events compared to regular days. Can you deduce any patterns about the types of events that cause the highest surge?


2. **Efficient Driver Positioning:** Given the patterns observed in the first question, propose a model using the `Rides` and `Drivers` tables that would predict areas with high demand on event days. How can we optimally position drivers in these high-demand areas, especially drivers with high ratings and more experience?
   

3. **Route Optimization for Matching:** Riders often have preferred routes. Using the `Rides` table, can you identify the most common routes taken on event days? How can this information be utilized to match riders with drivers familiar with these routes, ensuring a faster and smoother ride?

4. **Feedback Mechanism for Matching:** With the insights gathered from the previous questions, propose a feedback mechanism embedded within the app. This will allow riders and drivers to provide real-time feedback on the matching process, especially during peak hours on event days.
