## Questions

1. **Car Popularity Insight**: Uber believes that popular car models may be more attractive to potential drivers and have a higher lending rate. Using the **CarOwners** dataset, determine which car models are the most popular among our registered owners.

2. **Predicting Owner's Willingness**: One of the critical aspects for Uber's new venture is to understand which car owners might be willing to rent out their vehicles. Using data attributes from the **CarOwners** dataset like `CarAge`, `OwnerRating`, and `PreviousRentals`, develop a model to predict an owner's willingness. Discuss how you'd approach this problem, the kind of model you'd use, and its evaluation metrics.

3. **Lending Price Decision**: Pricing the lending service is crucial for both car owners and potential drivers. Using available data, discuss a mechanism to decide on a lending price. Consider aspects like car model popularity, owner preferences, and potential driver demand.

4. **Prelaunch Assessment**: Before launching this new service, it's essential to gauge its viability and potential risks. Discuss how you would assess the potential success of this initiative using the available data. Consider potential risks and how to do A/B test.
