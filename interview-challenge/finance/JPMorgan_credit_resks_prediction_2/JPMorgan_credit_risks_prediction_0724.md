## 3. Questions for the Data Challenge

### 1. Data Manipulation (SQL)

#### 1.1 **Question**: 
Suppose we want to evaluate the overall creditworthiness of our clients. However, for some customers, the Credit_Score information in the Credit_Data table is missing. Can you generate a query that provides a list of all CustomerIDs where the Credit_Score data is not yet available?

#### 1.2 **Question**: 
Using the Credit_Data table, can you calculate the cumulative loan amount for each customer, ordered by the loan term? What do you observe about the patterns of borrowing over time for customers?

### 2. Feature Processing and Feature Engineering (Python)

#### 2.2 **Question**: 
In the context of predicting credit default risks for potential loan borrowers, we have numerical features like 'Income', 'Loan_Amount', 'Credit_Score', and 'Age', and categorical features like 'Occupation', 'Education', 'Loan_Type'. How would you prepare these features for model training, specifically handling the categorical variables?

**Answer**:

  

1. **Data Understanding:** Before any transformation, it's essential to understand the data. For categorical variables like 'Occupation', 'Education', and 'Loan_Type', we should check the number of unique categories, frequency of each category, presence of missing values, etc.
This gives us a sense of how many categories there are in each variable, how balanced these categories are, and whether there's any category with very few samples.

  

3. **Handle Missing Values:** Next, we need to check if there are any missing values in the categorical features. If so, we might want to fill in these missing values with a new category (e.g., 'Unknown') or the most frequent category depending on the data context.

  



  

4. **Encoding:** To prepare these categorical features for machine learning algorithms, we can apply one-hot encoding. This will create binary (0 or 1) features for each category of the original feature. We can use pandas' `get_dummies()` function to do this.

  



5. **Dimensionality Check:** After one-hot encoding, we need to check the new dimensionality of our data. If the number of features has increased significantly due to categories with many unique values, we might need to consider other encoding methods (like target encoding) or dimensionality reduction techniques.


6. **Multicollinearity Check:** One hot encoding can sometimes lead to multicollinearity, especially when we have a category that's very rare. This could potentially harm some models like Linear Regression. To mitigate this, we can drop one category from each original feature (using the `drop_first=True` argument in `get_dummies()`) to remove perfect multicollinearity.

7. **Model Training:** Now, our dataset is ready to be used for model training. The model should now be able to handle the categorical features since they've been transformed to a numerical format.

### 3. Modeling Metrics (Python)

#### 3.1 **Question**: 
In credit default prediction, different types of errors have different costs. For instance, predicting a customer will not default when they actually will (False Negative) might be more costly than predicting a customer will default when they actually will not (False Positive). Given these considerations, what kind of performance metric would you suggest that we use instead of traditional ones like accuracy? Explain your choice and how it might be beneficial in this particular business context. Additionally, write a Python function to calculate this metric given the true labels and the model predictions.


**Answer:**  Given the cost implications of false negatives and false positives in this case, the F-beta score could be a suitable metric. The F-beta score is a weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall, with the beta parameter determining the weight of recall in the combined score.

In our case, where false negatives (predicting a customer will not default when they actually will) are more costly, we might choose a beta value greater than 1 to increase the influence of recall in the F-beta score.

In Python, the F-beta score can be calculated using the  `fbeta_score`  function from  `sklearn.metrics`. Code below is how to implement it.

The resulting F-beta score would give us a single metric that considers both the precision and recall of our model, while putting more emphasis on recall (minimizing false negatives).

The benefit of using this metric in our business context is that it accounts for the different costs of false positives and false negatives, providing a more nuanced view of model performance than traditional accuracy.

### 4. Machine Learning Modeling and Model Optimization(Python)


#### 4.1 **Question**: 
For our credit default prediction task, assume you have decided to initially start with Logistic Regression. With this model selection, what pre-training manipulation would implement? Why would you implement feature scaling for this model? Why is scaling important? Except Logistic Regression, what other models would require scaling? Please provide Python code to demonstrate.

**Answer**: For a task like credit default prediction, a good starting point could be logistic regression. It's simple to implement and understand, relatively efficient in terms of computational resources, and it can provide baseline performance.

  

Logistic regression, however, makes certain assumptions about the data - one of which is that the features are on a similar scale. This is because logistic regression calculates weights based on the raw numeric values of the features. If one feature has a range of 0-1 and another has a range of 0-1000, then the model may unduly emphasize the feature with the larger range.

  

Therefore, it's important to apply feature scaling before using logistic regression. Feature scaling standardizes the range of independent variables or features of the data, which can improve the convergence speed of gradient descent, which underlies many machine learning algorithms.

 
Python's `sklearn` library provides several methods for scaling features, including StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler. The code below shows how you could use StandardScaler.


This approach will scale the features so they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, helping ensure that no one feature disproportionately influences the logistic regression model.

  

Except for Logistic Regression, several machine learning algorithms require feature scaling for optimal performance. These include:

  

1. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: SVMs try to maximize the distance between the separating line (hyperplane) and the support vectors. If one feature has large values, it might dominate the other features when calculating the distance. Therefore, all features should be scaled to similar ranges.

  

2. **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**: This algorithm calculates the distance between pairs of samples, and scales have a direct impact. A feature with a large scale might dominate the calculation of the distance, so scaling features to the same range can prevent this issue.

  

3. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: PCA tries to get the features with maximum variance, and the variance is high for high magnitude features and skews the PCA towards high magnitude features.

  

4. **Gradient Descent Based Algorithms**: Machine learning algorithms like linear regression, logistic regression, neural network, etc. that use gradient descent as an optimization technique require data to be scaled. The presence of feature value X in the formula will affect the step size of the gradient descent. The algorithm converges faster when the scales are similar.

  
  

Note that decision trees and random forests are not distance-based and can handle various scales of features. Hence, scaling is not necessary while using these algorithms. Similarly, Naive Bayes algorithm doesn't require feature scaling as well.

#### 4.2 **Question**: 
Assume you have decided to optimize your model by using XGBoost instead of Logistic Regression. XGBoost is known for its speed and performance but it has quite a few hyperparameters to tune. How do you approach this? And what's your strategy to ensure you're not overfitting the model?

**Answer**:XGBoost, indeed, has a lot of hyperparameters to tune and the optimal configuration often depends on the specific dataset at hand. Here are the general steps I would take to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting:

  

1. **Define a Baseline Model:** Start by setting up XGBoost with default hyperparameters, then evaluate its performance. This gives us a baseline model.

  

2. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** There are different strategies for tuning, including grid search and random search. Grid search exhaustively tries every combination of provided hyperparameters which can be quite slow if we have many hyperparameters or if the dataset is large. Random search, on the other hand, tries random combinations of hyperparameters. It may miss the optimal setting, but it often finds a good setting much faster than grid search.

  

There are also more advanced tuning methods, like Bayesian Optimization, which is a probabilistic model-based method of hyperparameter optimization.

  

3. **Cross-Validation:** Implement k-fold cross-validation for robustness. This means splitting the dataset into k-parts (folds), training the model on k-1 parts, and validating on the remaining part. This is done in a round-robin fashion so that each fold serves as the validation set once.

  

4. **Regularization:** XGBoost has built-in L1 (Lasso Regression) and L2 (Ridge Regression) regularization which can prevent overfitting. Regularization introduces a penalty on the different parameters of the model to reduce the freedom of the model and prevent overfitting.

  

5. **Early Stopping:** Another way to prevent overfitting is to use early stopping. In XGBoost, we can set the `early_stopping_rounds` parameter which causes the model training to stop if performance on a validation set doesn't improve after a given number of rounds.

  

6. **Use a Validation Set:** Always keep a hold-out set for which the model did not see the data in training. This will give a good sense of how well the model is likely to perform on unseen data.

The code below is an example of how you could tune hyperparameters using grid search and cross-validation in Python with the `sklearn` library's `GridSearchCV`.

 
####  4.3 **Question**: 

With XGBoost, our model's AUC-ROC score is high, but when we deploy it in production, the actual positive predictive value (precision) is much lower than expected. What could explain this discrepancy and how would you investigate?

**Answer**: A high AUC-ROC score suggests that the model has a good measure of separability and is able to distinguish between the positive class (defaults) and the negative class (non-defaults). However, precision (or positive predictive value) is a different metric that evaluates the correctness of positive predictions made by the model.

  

If precision is low, it means that many of the cases predicted as defaults by the model are actually not defaults. The discrepancy between a high AUC-ROC score and a low precision in production can occur due to several reasons:

  

1. **Class Imbalance**: If there's a significant class imbalance in the dataset (which is likely in credit default prediction), precision can be impacted. A model trained on such a dataset might predict the majority class most of the time. ROC-AUC score is not sensitive to class imbalance, but precision is.

  

2. **Threshold Selection**: The default threshold for binary classification tasks is often set at 0.5, but this might not always be the best threshold for every problem. The threshold for classification can have a significant impact on precision. You might need to adjust the threshold based on the costs of false negatives and false positives.

  

3. **Model Overfitting**: If the model has overfit the training data, it might perform well on the test data (resulting in a high AUC-ROC score), but perform poorly on new unseen data (resulting in a low precision).

  

4. **Data Shift**: If the production data has different characteristics compared to the data the model was trained and evaluated on, the model's performance can degrade. This is sometimes referred to as "concept drift" or "data drift".

  

Here's how I would investigate and address these issues:

  

**Class Imbalance**: Use techniques like oversampling the minority class, undersampling the majority class, or using SMOTE to create a balanced dataset. Consider using a cost-sensitive method or changing the evaluation metric to something more sensitive to class imbalance like Precision, Recall, F1-score or use AUC-PR (Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve) instead of AUC-ROC.

  

**Threshold Selection**: Perform a threshold optimization analysis to select the threshold that maximizes a desired metric (for example, Youden’s J statistic). The optimal threshold depends on the specific costs of false negatives and false positives for the problem.

  

**Model Overfitting**: Make sure to use a validation set for tuning hyperparameters and regularization to avoid overfitting. Perform k-fold cross-validation for more robustness.

  

**Data Shift**: Implement data monitoring to detect shifts in the production data over time. If shifts are detected, you might need to retrain your model on more recent data or adjust your model to take these shifts into account. You could also look into using online learning techniques to continuously update your model with new data.

  

Finally, communicate these insights to stakeholders. Understanding the balance between different types of errors (false positives vs false negatives) is often key to making business decisions. And ensure to use interpretable models or model explanation techniques, as understanding how your model makes predictions can often lead to insights into why its precision is lower than expected.

### 5. Business Insights 

#### 5.1 **Question**:
If customers with a certain occupation type have a higher likelihood of defaulting on their loans, what business strategies could be employed to mitigate this risk?
**Answer**: If the data reveals that customers with a certain occupation type have a higher likelihood of defaulting on their loans, several business strategies could be considered to mitigate this risk:

  

1. **Risk-adjusted pricing**: The bank could consider adjusting the interest rate charged to customers based on their perceived risk of default. Higher risk customers could be charged a higher interest rate to compensate for the increased risk. This strategy needs to be balanced carefully with considerations of fairness and legality.

  

2. **Credit counseling and financial education**: If a certain occupation group is particularly prone to default, it could be beneficial to offer targeted financial education or credit counseling to these customers. This could help them manage their finances better and potentially lower their risk of default.

  

3. **Loan terms adjustment**: The bank could consider altering loan terms for riskier occupation categories, such as lowering the maximum loan amount or shortening the loan term. This could potentially reduce the exposure of the bank to defaults from these customers.

  

4. **Insurance and guarantee products**: If available and applicable, some sort of insurance or guarantee products can be encouraged among these customers, which could safeguard against the risk of default.

  

5. **Enhanced underwriting**: The bank could invest in enhanced underwriting practices for customers from riskier occupations. This could include deeper background checks, more rigorous employment and income verification, and so on.

  

6. **Alternative loan products**: The bank could develop alternative loan products designed specifically for higher-risk customers. These products could have features that encourage regular repayments, such as discounts or rewards for consistent on-time payments.
